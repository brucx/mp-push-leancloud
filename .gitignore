# > Files to exclude from your app's repo.
#
# This file (`.gitignore`) is only relevant if
# you are using git.
#
# It exists to signify to git that certain files
# and/or directories should be ignored for the
# purposes of version control.
#
# This keeps tmp files and sensitive credentials
# from being uploaded to  your repository.  And
# it allows you to configure your app for your
# machine without accidentally committing settings
# which will smash the local settings of other
# developers on your team.
#
# Some reasonable defaults are included below,
# but, of course, you should modify/extend/prune
# to fit your needs!
